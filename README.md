# release notes generator

## rng is java program for creating release notes from scm history (only git supported for now)

## Steps of work

1. Building configuration either from cli parameters and/or from given properties configuration file
2. Getting git log messages limited by tag(s) or commit id(s)
3. Matching jira issue ids from git messages based on given pattern
4. Creating report in html
5. Pushing generated report to git remote repository

## Sample use

### Command line with configuration .properties file
Parameters for program can be defined in .properties file defined by cli parameter named _configurationFilePath_

	java -jar target/release-notes-generator-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar -configurationFilePath ./configuration.properties -tag1 0.19.0.20
sample configuration.properties file can be found in src/test/resources/configuration.properties

### Command line with cli parameters
	java -jar target/release-notes-generator-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar -tag1 0.19.0.20 -gitDirectory "C:/temp/project" -gitBranch develop -gitUrl "https://github.company.com" -gitUsername username -gitPassword password -jiraUrl "https://jira.company.com" -jiraUsername username -jiraPassword password -jiraIssuePattern "SYM-\\d+"

### Java use
Java level use can be best achieved through builder ```com.infusion.relnotesgen.MainInvoker```
Check ```com.infusion.relnotesgen.MainITTest``` for appropriate use case.

	new MainInvoker()
                .pushReleaseNotes(true)
                .gitDirectory(localGit.getAbsolutePath())
                .gitBranch("master")
				...
                .invoke();

## Known issues

#### Jira ssl certificate
Attlasian jira client used in rng requires to have valid certificate for jira address stored in jre key store.
Detailed instruction on how add new certificate to sore:
https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/STASHKB/SSLHandshakeException+-+unable+to+find+valid+certification+path+to+requested+target

#### Search by latest tags
When rng is run without commitId\* and tag\* parameters then release notes will be generated for last 2 tags.
It may happen that those 2 tags are connected to commits that are not available on branch which rng is using - in that case RuntimeException will be thrown with message:
_No commit were found for given commit ids commitId1, commitId2. Maybe branch is badly chosen._
